# ConwaysGOL3D
a 3D implementation of Conway's Game of Life with several different rulesets to visualize with

The rulesets for the demo were retrieved from:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQJ5aEsP6Fs
and a paper that I now cannot find for the life of me just trust me

The rulesets are:
## Amoeba
Cells with 5/6/7/12/13/15 neighbors survive and revives if it has between 9 and 26 neighbors
## L445
Cells with 4 neighbors survive and revive
## L678
Cells with between 6 and 8 neighbors survive and revive
## L1021
Cells with between 10 and 21 cells survive and revive
## L3
Cells with 3 neighbors survive and revive
## L23
Cells with 3 neighbors survives and revives with either 2 or 3 neighbors
## L5655
Cells with 5 or 6 neighbors survives and revives with only 5 neighbors
## L5766
Cells with 6 neighbors survives and revives with between 5 and 7 neighbors
## Builder
Cells with 4/6/8/9 neighbors survives and revives with 2/6/9 neighbors
## Clouds1
Cells with 13/14/17/18/19 neighbors survive nad revive with between 13 and 26 neighbors
## Clouds2
Cells with 13 or 14 neighbors survive and revives with between 13 and 26 neighbors
## Pyroclastic
Cells with between 6 and 8 neighbors survive and revives with between 4 and 7 neighbors
## Slow Decay
Cells with between 13 and 26 neighbors survive and revives with 1/4/8/13/26 neighbors
## Spiky Growth 
Cells with 4/13/17/20/24/26 neighbors survives and revives with 0/3/7/9/11/13/18/21/22/24/26 neighbors
